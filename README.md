# Sentence-Builder
Program uses "word" and "sentence" classes to build a sentence. The word class uses arrays and a random number generator to provide random words for each part of speach to the sentence class. The sentence class takes those parts of speach and appends them into a sentence. The SentenceBuilder class calls the methods from the sentence class to generate 20 random sentences.
